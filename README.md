# GA-SEI-Unit-1-Project
April 2022

This website was my first major project as a student in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program. I made a lot of mistakes, and learned a great deal about how HTML CSS and JavaScript interact to provide a great user experience. Form !== function was the biggest lesson for me, and I will give the planning and design process much more attention going forward. All told, it was a great introduction to development and an experience I will take with me as I progress through my career.
